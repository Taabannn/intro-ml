# HW5
### Q5
* part 1: 
  * Using PCA to compress 213 images in 6 classes (Happy, Fear, Angery, Disgust, Surprise and Sad)
  * Obtaining eigenvals of PCA and plotting 4 first and 4 last eigenfaces 
* part 2:
  * Using LDA on previous dataset
  * Obtaining eigenvals of LDA and plotting seperability measure (trace($S_W^{-1}S_B$))
### Q6
* Classifying images based on R and G in color distribution (RGB) by implementing EM algorithm and estimating GMM model with 2 components, then reporting the results of GMM parameters with illustrating each individual classes' contours
  * The GMM model of images for both Chelsea club and Manchester United players converged after 50 iterations
* Obtaining optimum value of k (the number of components) by cross validation methods (both p leave out and k-fold approaches are utilized)
