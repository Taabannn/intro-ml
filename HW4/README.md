# HW4
### Q4
* Implementing SVM classifier on Petal Length and Width features of iris data with three different kernels: rbf, linear, polynomial
* Observing the impact of Gamma and Regularization hyperparameters on trained model, then find the optimum value of each by using grid search method
* Utilizing one-vs-rest and one-vs-one classification approaches (based on SVM) with three different kernels(rbf, linear, polynomial) 
### Q6
* Implementing two-class classifier by given ensemble model based on majority vote
* accuracy of each individual classifier is 51%
* Goal: Obtaining the accuracy when the number of classifiers (N) approaches $\infty$
### Q7
